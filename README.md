# Battle Park

This is a silly game about amusement parks, explosives, and the sale of ambiguously ethical "food." It's not done, and likely never will be, but it's still a fun project for now.

# How to Play

There are two ways to get into the game. The first is to create a match, inputting your desired username and room name, and then waiting for others to join. The other is to find a game, inputting your desired username and selecting from a list of created, but not ready, games. From there you can place things. Nice.
